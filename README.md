ABOUT THE PROJECT 

This website aims at helping farmers, to know about their soil type, fertilizers and possible crops and which are the crops suitable for cultivation in that land through their soil test results. It also gives the information about common pest attacking the crops, fertilizers and different irrigation methods needed for the crops are provided by this website. This provides a platform to farmers to know the different loan, schemes and seminars conducted by the government. 
The main features of the Agro Culture are as follows: 
• Analyse the existing farming systems and identify its constraints & problems. 
•  Design a new or improved farming system. 
•  Identify conditions for successful implementation of the system. 
•  Officer will be focusing on registration of labs, managing extra fact details, updating upcoming seminars etc. 
• User deals with taking appointment for seminars and soil testing directly to the lab and to the officer.  
• Any user can assign and request land. 

 
SYSTEM ANALYSIS 
  
System analysis is an important phase of any system development process. The system is studied to the minute details and analysed. The system analyst plays the role of an interrogator and dwells deep in to the working of the present system. In analysis, a detailed study of these operations performed by a system and their relationships within and outside the system is done. A key question considered here is, “what must be done to solve the problem?” The system is viewed as a whole and the inputs to the system are identified. Once analysis is completed, the analyst has a firm understanding of what is to be done.  System analysis is a problem-solving technique that breaks down a system into its component pieces for the purpose of the studying how well those component parts work and interact to accomplish their purpose. System analysis is conducted for the purpose of studying a system or its parts in order to identify its objectives. It is a problem-solving technique that improves the system and ensures that all the components of the system work efficiently to accomplish their purpose. System analysis is used in every field where something is developed. Analysis can also be a series of components that perform organic functions together, such as system engineering. System engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering that focuses on how complex engineering projects should be designed and managed.


EXISTING SYSTEM  

Farming information sites are increasingly popular and a large amount of data is available from there. The existing systems are not discussing about the schemes and loans passed by the government. These kinds of announcements are still done by the means of newspaper and thaluk offices. As time passed the reachability of internet is made worldwide so clubbing all the details announced by the government through this web service make the work easy. In the agricultural office there is no facility for users to sell and buy agricultural products now. The main disadvantage of existing system there is lot paper work in agricultural office and chance of loss of these crucial documents is much higher. 

Limitations of Existing System  
• The existing facilities don’t give a provision to take an appointment for soil test directly.  
• The seminars conducted by the agricultural departments are informed to the people via 
telephone and newspaper.  
•  The announcements done by the agricultural departments are not known to the 
common people.

2.2 PROPOSED SYSTEM  
The existing farming information sites are not dealing with the soil texting or not about any agricultural offices. The farmers of now days are even knowing about the government 
announcement through telephone and thaluk offices so this will be much more better if we could bring all these under a single roof. We propose such a project proposal with an aim that whenever this comes to real world Agro Culture is definitely going to meet the needs of common man in farming field to some extent. In our system, there are user to assign lands to other user for cultivation of crops. 

Advantages of Proposed System 
•  Any doubts regarding the cultivation can be cleared through here.  
•  A general information about new crop fertilizers etc. are available here.  
•  The soil is being tested in order to reap maximum outcome out of it by ensuring the quality of soil. 
• The system gives updates of various governmental schemes for users. 
• The user can book for seminars. 
• The user have the option to take lab appointment. 

Features of Proposed System  
• The users can buy various agricultural equipment from agricultural officer. 
• The users are able to sell their products. 
• The agricultural officer can view and manage seeds, fertilizer and other equipment. 
• The users can attend seminars related to agro culture.
