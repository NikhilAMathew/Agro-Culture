ABOUT THE PROJECT 

This website aims at helping farmers, to know about their soil type, fertilizers and possible crops and which are the crops suitable for cultivation in that land through their soil test results. It also gives the information about common pest attacking the crops, fertilizers and different irrigation methods needed for the crops are provided by this website. This provides a platform to farmers to know the different loan, schemes and seminars conducted by the government. 
The main features of the Agro Culture are as follows: 
• Analyse the existing farming systems and identify its constraints & problems. 
•  Design a new or improved farming system. 
•  Identify conditions for successful implementation of the system. 
•  Officer will be focusing on registration of labs, managing extra fact details, updating upcoming seminars etc. 
• User deals with taking appointment for seminars and soil testing directly to the lab and to the officer.  
• Any user can assign and request land. 

 
SYSTEM ANALYSIS 
  
System analysis is an important phase of any system development process. The system is studied to the minute details and analysed. The system analyst plays the role of an interrogator and dwells deep in to the working of the present system. In analysis, a detailed study of these operations performed by a system and their relationships within and outside the system is done. A key question considered here is, “what must be done to solve the problem?” The system is viewed as a whole and the inputs to the system are identified. Once analysis is completed, the analyst has a firm understanding of what is to be done.  System analysis is a problem-solving technique that breaks down a system into its component pieces for the purpose of the studying how well those component parts work and interact to accomplish their purpose. System analysis is conducted for the purpose of studying a system or its parts in order to identify its objectives. It is a problem-solving technique that improves the system and ensures that all the components of the system work efficiently to accomplish their purpose. System analysis is used in every field where something is developed. Analysis can also be a series of components that perform organic functions together, such as system engineering. System engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering that focuses on how complex engineering projects should be designed and managed.
